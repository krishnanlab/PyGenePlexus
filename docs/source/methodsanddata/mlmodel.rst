ML Model
========

In GenePlexus, the supervised machine learning model uses the connections of a user chosen genome-scale molecular network as feature vectors. As described above, these feature vectors can be one of three representations; Adjacency, Influence and Embedding. PyGenePlexus uses logistic regression with l2-regularization as the supervised learning algorithm and is implemented using the python package `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html>`_. After training a model using the labeled genes, the trained model is used to classify all the genes in the chosen network, returning a prediction probability for these genes that is bounded between 0 and 1. The regularization parameter is set to 1.0 ny default but can be changed by the user.
