Determing Postitive and Negative Samples
========================================

PyGenePlexus uses a supervised machine learning model for predicting the association of all the genes in the network to the user supplied gene set. To build the classification boundary the model requires both positive and negative training examples. The positive set of genes is any gene from the user-supplied gene list that is able to be converted to an Entrez ID and found in the chosen network. The user can then choose if they want to define genes in the negative class based on one of two gene set collections, biological processes from the [GO]_ or diseases from [DisGeNet]_, based on whether the input genes better represent a cellular process/pathway or a disease. GenePlexus then automatically selects the genes in the negative class by:

#. Consider the total pool of possible negative genes to be any gene that has an annotation to at least one of the terms in the selected gene set collection
#. Remove genes that are in the positive class.
#. For every term in a gene set collection, we perform a one-sided Fisherâ€™s exact test between the genes in the positive class and the genes annotated to the given term. If the p-value of the test is less than 0.05, all genes from the given term are also removed from the pool of possible negative genes.
#. The remaining genes in the pool of possible negative genes are used in the negative class. Note that most genes in the network are not contained in the positive class or negative class and are considered as part of the unlabeled class.
