"""PyGenePlexus is a Python package for running the [GenePlexus]_ model.

.. currentmodule:: geneplexus.GenePlexus

PyGenePlexus enables researchers to predict novel genes similar to their
genes of interest based on their patterns of connectivity in genome-scale
molecular interaction networks.

  Probably put Figure from the paper here?

Given a list of input genes and a geneset collection (:term:`GSC`) to help
select negative examples, the package trains a logistic regression model
using one of three network derived features (:term:`adjacency`,
:term:`influence`, or :term:`embedding`) and generates the following outputs

#. Genome-wide prediction of how **functionally similar** a gene is  to the \
input gene list. See :meth:`fit_and_predict`
#. (Optional) Interpretability of the model is provided by comparing the \
model trained on the user gene set to models pretrained on 1000's of known \
gene sets from [GO]_ bioloigcal proceses and [DisGeNet]_ diseases. See \
:meth:`make_sim_dfs`
#. (Optional) Interpretability of the top predicted genes is provided by \
returning their network connectivity. :meth:`make_small_edgelist`

Quick start
-----------

PyGenePlexus comes with an easy to use command line interface (CLI) to run the
full GenePlexus pipeline given an input gene list. Go get started, install via
pip and run a quick example as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install geneplexus
    geneplexus -i my_gene_list.txt --output_dir my_result

Note that you need to supply the ``my_gene_list.txt`` file, which is a line
separated gene list text file  (NCBI Entrez IDs, Symbol or Ensembl IDs are
accepted). An example can be found on the
`GitHub page <https://github.com/krishnanlab/PyGenePlexus>`_ under
``example/input_genes.txt``. More info can be found in :ref:`PyGenePlexus CLI`.

.. warning::

    All necessary files for a specific selection of parameters (network,
    feature, and gene set collection) will be downloaded automatically and
    saved under ``~/.data/geneplexus``. User can also specify the location of
    data to be saved using the ``--output_dir`` argument. **The example
    provided will download files that occupy ~300MB of space.**


Using the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A quick example of generating predictions using an input gene list. More info
can be found in :ref:`PyGenePlexus API`.

.. code-block::

    >>> from geneplexus import GenePlexus
    >>> input_genes = ["ARL6", "BBS1", "BBS10", "BBS12", "BBS2", "BBS4",
    ...                "BBS5", "BBS7", "BBS9", "CCDC28B", "CEP290", "KIF7",
    ...                "MKKS", "MKS1", "TRIM32", "TTC8", "WDPCP"]
    >>> gp = GenePlexus(net_type="STRING", features="Embedding", gsc="DisGeNet",
    ...                 input_genes=input_genes, auto_download=True, \
log_level="INFO")
    >>> df_probs = gp.fit_and_predict()[1]
    >>> df_probs.iloc[:10]

Supported networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, GenePlexus come with four networks, including [BioGRID]_,
[STRING]_ (default), [STRING-EXP]_, and [GIANT-TN]_. Prediction using a
custom network can also be done, see :ref:`Using custom networks`.
However, when using a custom network, the model similarity
analysis *cannot* be done due to the lack to pretrained models.
